### Elevator

An elevator is given an input code which it then uses to go up or down floors: 

"^" = go up one floor 

"v" (lower-case v) = go down one floor 

The elevator starts on floor 0. 

### Question

Which floor will "^v^^v^^vv^vv^vv^^vvv^^v^^^vv^^^vv^v^^vvv^^^^^v^v^v^v^vv^^vvv^^^^vvv^^vvv^^^^^vvvv^^vvv^vv^^vv^vv^v^^^" end up?
